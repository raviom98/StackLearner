## Features: Author's and Tasks

### Daksh Patel
As a part of this assignment I was responsible for developing the complete user management feature along with authorization and authentication.
I  have developed completely pluggable and modular code by using middleware for user authentication (backend), and protecting post-login routes by creating a wrapper component for the routes.
#### User management
Implemented the complete user management feature. User management feature includes the following:

* Signup
* Signin
* Signout
* User Authentication
* Update profile
* Forgot Password

**Back-End Service: user management and authentication**
```
The files I have worked on are as follow:
.
├── express-server
│   ├──globals.js                   # added createResponse method for global usage
│   ├── modules
│   │   ├── authentication          # Made all the files in "./express-server/modules/authentication/*"
│   │   ├── mailer                  # Made all the files in "./express-server/modules/mailer/*"

│   │   ├── user.model.js           # Made the models file for user information management.

```

### Mansoor Ghazi
As part of this assignment, I was responsible for developing, testing, and integrating the *Learning Path* feature. The feature is briefly presented in the following discussion.

#### Learning Path Feature
The **Learning Path** feature enables students to access a dashboard, that gives them access to the projects, and their tutorials.

The feature is composed of a back-end service, and a set of front-end components, the directory listings for which are presented in the following sections.

**Back-End Service: Learning Path Feature**
The **Learning Path** feature’s back-end includes the following directories and files:
```
|------ express-server
	|---- modules
		|---- learningpath
			|---- learningpath.controllers.js
			|---- learningpath.routers.js
	|---- models
		|--- learningpath.models.js
```
As evident from above, the feature’s back-end service consists of models, controllers, and routes.

**Front-End Components: Learning Path Feature**
The **Learning Path** feature’s front-end is made up of a set of React components. These components are organised as follows:
```
|------ react-client
	|---- src
		|---- components
			|---- StudentDashboard
				|---- Header.js
				|---- Hero.js
				|---- Main.js
				|---- Projects.js
				|---- Project.js
				|---- StudentDashboard.js
			|---- Curriculum
				|---- Curriculum.js
				|---- Header.js
				|---- Main.js
				|---- TutorialPlayer.js
```
The feature’s components are organised into two different set of components: `StudentDashboard` and `Curriculum`.

### Ravi Patel
As part of this assignment, I was responsible for developing, testing, and integrating the *Progress Tracking* feature. The feature is briefly presented in the following discussion.

#### Progress Tracking Feature
This feature will enable students to track their progress across multiple learning paths, projects, and tutorials. Students will be able to resume learning from where they last left, as well as reset their progress to start afresh.

The feature is composed of a back-end service, and a set of front-end components, the directory listings for which are presented in the following sections.

**Back-End Service: Progress Tracking Feature**
```
|------ express-server
	|---- modules
		|---- progresstracking
			|---- progresstracking.controllers.js
			|---- progresstracking.routers.js
	|---- models
		|--- progresstracking.models.js
```

**Front-End Components: Progress Tracking Feature**
The **Progress Tracking** feature’s front-end is made up of a set of React components. These components are organised as follows:
```
|------ react-client
	|---- src
		|---- components
			|---- StudentDashboard
				|---- Header.js
				|---- Hero.js
				|---- Main.js
				|---- Project.js
				|---- Projects.js
				|---- StudentDashboard.js
			|---- Curriculum
				|---- Curriculum.js
				|---- Header.js
				|---- Main.js
				|---- TutorialPlayer.js
```
The feature’s components are organised into two different set of components: `StudentDashboard` and `Curriculum`.

## Code Referencing
No code was referenced from any online resource.

## Integration
A feature-based workflow was adopted that involved developing assigned features on separated branches, and then merging them on the master branch.
